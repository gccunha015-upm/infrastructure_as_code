# Infrastructure as Code

## About

**Vagrant** and **Ansible** infrastructure as code to configure an e-commerce website that is composed of database, web and monitor servers.

## Why

Developed as a requirement for the **laboratório de engenharia de software (software engineering laboratory)** subject during my 6th semester of Computer Science.

## Tools used

- [vagrant]
- [ansible]

## Observations

1. The file `devopsnapratica.war` was too big (~126MB), so GitHub doesn`t allow it (100MB max). The process to generate it is described in [Casa do Código]'s book, [DevOps na Prática]. The repository is [Loja Virtual DevOps].
